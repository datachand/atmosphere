    <p>
      As part of the ongoing transition from packages hosted here (atmosphere.meteor.com) to an <i>official</i> Meteor Development Group hosted package system (supported by the core <code>meteor</code> app, yay!), we've built this page to help you to connect your meteor developer account to your atmosphere account.

    {{#if currentUser}}
      <h4><i>Step One:</i> You're signed in as <code>{{currentUser.username}}</code>.</h4>

      {{#if currentUser.services.meteor-developer}}
        <h4><i>Step Two:</i> You've connected your Meteor Developer account: <code>{{currentUser.services.meteor-developer.username}}</code></h4>
        
        <h4><i>Step Three:</i> You're done! Sit back, profit, party, write packages, whatever comes to you.</h4>
        
        <p>
          For now, you'll continue publishing packages with your old Atmopshere account ({{currentUser.username}}). But soon, you'll <em>need</em> an Meteor Developer account to do so. Congratulations, you are officially ahead of the game!
