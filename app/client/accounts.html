    <h2>Atmosphere v1 Accounts</h2>
    
    <p>
      As you may have noticed, Atmosphere has migrated to a <a href="https://atmospherejs.com">new domain</a> and layout. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is the first stage towards a transition to packages being hosted by the Meteor Development Group, and Atmosphere simply serving as a front end to viewing and listing packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, in the interim, Meteorite continues to exist, and uses this site  to access packages. So if you want to publish packages, you'll need an account on this site.
    </p>
    
    {{#if currentUser}}
      <p>You already have an account ({{loginButtons align="right"}}). You champ.</p>
    {{else}}
      <p>Don't worry, it's simple. Just {{loginButtons align="right"}}</p>
    {{/if}}
    
    <h2>Connect your Meteor Developer Account</h2>
    
    <p>
      The next step of the process will be a migration of packages from this site to an <i>official</i> repository (yay!). One part of that will be associating Meteor Developer accounts with packages.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      We've built this page to help you to connect your meteor developer account to your atmosphere account.
    </p>
    
    {{#if currentUser}}
      <h4>Step One:</h4> 
      <p>You're signed in as <code>{{currentUser.username}}</code>.</p>

      {{#if currentUser.services.meteor-developer}}
        <h4>Step Two:</h4>
        <p>You've connected your Meteor Developer account: <code>{{currentUser.services.meteor-developer.username}}</code></p>
        
        <h4>Step Three:</h5>
        <p>You're done! Sit back, profit, party, write packages, whatever comes to you.</p>
        
        <p>
          For now, you'll continue publishing packages with your old Atmopshere account ({{currentUser.username}}). But soon, you'll <em>need</em> an Meteor Developer account to do so. Congratulations, you are officially ahead of the game!
        </p>
        
      {{else}}
      
        <h4>Step Two:</h4>
        <p>You need a Meteor Developer account:
        <a class="add">Connect</a>.</p>
      {{/if}}
    {{else}}
      <h4>Step One</h4> 
      <p>You need to sign in to your atmosphere account, or sign up for one.</p>
    {{/if}}
